# Cricket Match Winner Prediction & Best Model Selection

Predicting cricket match outcomes is a challenging and exciting problem. This project focuses on predicting the winner of international cricket matches using historical data, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and selecting the best machine learning model for accurate predictions.

## 🏏 Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Analyze international cricket match data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and key features affecting match outcomes.
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models to predict match winners.
- Select the most accurate model for real-world prediction.

The project provides insights into factors that influence cricket matches and demonstrates how data-driven models can assist in outcome prediction.

## 📊 Features
